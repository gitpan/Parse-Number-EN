NAME
    Parse::Number::EN - Pattern to match number

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.05 of Parse::Number::EN (from Perl
    distribution Parse-Number-EN), released on 2014-10-03.

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::EN qw(parse_number_en $Pat);

     my @a = map {parse_number_en(text=>$_)}
         ("12,345.67", "-1.2e3", "x123", "1.23", "1,23");
     # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23, 1)

     my @b = map {/^$Pat$/ ? 1:0}
         ("12,345.67", "-1.2e3", "x123", "1,23");
     # @b = (1, 1, 0, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    The goal for this module is to parse/extract numbers written in some
    common notation in English text. That means, in addition to what Perl
    does, it also recognizes thousand separators (and fractions, percentages
    in the future).

FUNCTIONS
  parse_number_en(%args) -> any
    Parse number from English text.

    This function can parse number with thousand separators (e.g. 10,000).

    In the future percentage (e.g. 10.2%) and fractions (e.g. 1/3, 2 1/2)
    might also be supported.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   text* => *str*

        The input text that contains number.

    Return value:

     (any)

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100%
    perfect (the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and
    fast.

FAQ
  How does this module differ from other number-parsing modules?
    This module uses a single regex and provides the regex for you to use.
    Other modules might be more accurate and/or faster. But this module is
    pretty fast.
