VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     use Parse::Number::EN qw(parse_number_en $Pat);

     my @a = map {parse_number_id(text=>$_)}
         ("12,345.67", "-1.2e3", "x123", "1.23", "1,23");
     # @a = (12345.67, -1200, undef, 1.23, 1)

     my @b = map {/^$Pat$/ ? 1:0}

     # @b = (1, 1, 0, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides $Pat and parse_number_en().

VARIABLES
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  $Pat (REGEX)
    A regex for quickly matching/extracting number from text. It's not 100%
    perfect (the extracted number might not be valid), but it's simple and
    fast.

SEE ALSO
    Lingua::EN::Words2Nums

    Other Parse::Number::* modules.

DESCRIPTION
    This module has Rinci metadata.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  parse_number_en(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Parse number from English text.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   text* => *str*

        The input text that contains number.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
